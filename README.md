# VanillaJS WebChat

## Why VanillaJS?

Everytime we think about creating a new application, one of the first things that come to us is: "Which framework... ".

The intention here is to show how would be to create this app using the good and old VanillaJS :)

## Build and Running

### To run it in dev mode

From the root directory run `npm run start` and it will startup the Webpack local server for you.

### To build the statics

From the root directory run `npm run build` and it will create a `dist` directory containing all the necessary static files
